# dao-dao-dapp

Web application for creating and managing multiple DAOs. Live in production at [daodao.zone](https://daodao.zone).

## Development

See [development](../README.md) for working with Turborepo.

## Environments

You can choose which environment you want to connect to. The default development environment is [Juno Testnet](#testnet).

### Testnet

Note: you can get Juno Testnet tokens ($JUNOX) from the #faucet channel in the main [Juno Discord](https://discord.com/invite/QcWPfK4gJ2). Testnet environment variables are in `.env.development` and available by default when running `yarn dev` command.

```bash
yarn dev # starts nextjs dev server
```

### Advanced: Other environments

By default `yarn dev` connects to the testnet. For developing against localhost or mainnet, copy the appropriate `.env` file to `.env.local`. Having a `.env.local` file will override the default `.env.development` file when running `yarn dev`.

#### Localhost

This will be using a local development instance in Docker. See the [dao-contracts repo](https://github.com/DA0-DA0/dao-contracts#deploying-in-a-development-environment) for instructions on running a local development environment.

```bash
cp .env.localhost .env.local
```

#### Mainnet

NOTE: this will be using the real Juno network and real $JUNO tokens. Use with caution. We highly recommend using the [Juno Testnet .env config](#testnet) for local development.

```bash
cp .env.mainnet .env.local
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

Note: If you change `.env.local`, you'll sometimes need to re-add the chain to Keplr. If you [select a different chain](https://highlander-nodes.medium.com/junoswap-how-to-reset-chain-config-3e2470a9c1e1) in Keplr (like Cosmos), you can scroll down and remove the "Wasmd Test" chain, then you can re-add it by connecting your wallet.

## Requirements

Please ensure you have the [Keplr wallet extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/keplr/dmkamcknogkgcdfhhbddcghachkejeap) installed in your Chrome based browser (Chrome, Brave, etc).
