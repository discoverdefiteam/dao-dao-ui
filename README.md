## DAO DAO UI

This project creates a web UI around the [DAO DAO V1 smart contracts](https://github.com/DA0-DA0/dao-contracts). Enabling users to:

- Create a governance token based DAO or multisig
- View proposals and treasury info
- Easily create proposals
- Vote on proposals

All without having to code!
