# @dao-dao/i18n

Translations for the DAO DAO UI.

## Contributing a translation

See `./locales/en/translation.json`. Make a folder with your language's (ISO 639-1)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes] code and place your translation there. When you're done, make sure to add your language's code to the `config.i18n.locales` array in the `./next-i18next.config.js` file.

### Translation notes

Keep it precise and pithy, in that order; people's businesses depend on understanding what this software does. Within those constraints, keep it as casual and informal as possible.
